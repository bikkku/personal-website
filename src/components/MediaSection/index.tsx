            I was heavily inspired by Hyun's Dojo during the era of stickfigure
            animations on platforms like NewGrounds, FluidAnims, and YouTube.
            During high school, I started to make my own stick figure
            animations. The learning curve was vast, but with my foundation in
            traditional art I adjusted to drawing on digital platforms quickly,
            and even made it on to one of Dojo's collab YouTube videos.

          <Text className="mb-4 mt-8">
            Later on, I began to expand my horizons and started working on more
            full-body animations. This is much more difficult and time consuming
            compared to stick figures, but I found the process of drawing frame
            by frame that much more rewarding when seeing the finished product.
            This time, I drew inspiration from professional Sakuga, which is a
            term used to describe particularly high-quality and striking
            animation sequences. My favourite sources of this come from shows
            like Mob Psycho, Ping Pong the animation, and many works from Studio
            Ghibli.

          Outside of software development, I love exploring creativity through
          digital media. This section showcases my work in gaming content, art,
          and animation. Whether through gameplay montages or original artwork,
          I enjoy using creative outlets to experiment, engage audiences, and
          just simply to express myself. The videos I make are just for fun,
          targeted mostly towards my friends, so videos may include inside
          jokes. Check out my channel{' '}

          One of my greatest passions is eSports, I love watching the pinnacle
          of video games I am interested in through both online live broadcasts
          as well as attending events in person when given the opportunity.
          Every aspect of eSports is exciting to me, from the anxious shuffling
          of rosters during the offseason, to the intensity of the winning
          moment during the biggest tournament of the year, and especially
          following the storylines and histories of the players and teams that
          create more exciting matchups.

          My favourite titles to watch are: Counter-Strike, League of Legends,
          and highly mechanical platform fighters such as Super Smash Bros.
          Melee and Rivals of Aether 2.
